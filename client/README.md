This is a full-stack Forum App built by Josephine Kwao with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, allowing users to register, log in, and access a protected dashboard where they can view pet categories and post questions. The frontend uses React Router for navigation, Axios for API requests, and local storage to persist user sessions, while the backend handles authentication with JWT and stores data using Mongoose. Users can browse questions by category and submit new ones through a responsive dashboard UI. The project follows a component-based structure and includes dummy data for testing. To run the app, install dependencies in both client and server, set up a .env file with database and JWT details, then start the backend and frontend separately. Future improvements include adding answers, upvoting, user profiles, dark mode, and image uploads.
